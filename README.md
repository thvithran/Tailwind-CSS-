## What is [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

Tailwind CSS is different from frameworks like Bootstrap, Foundation, or Bulma because it is not a UI kit, and it does not have default themes or built-in UI components. It is a very powerful framework in terms of customization, of course, if you donâ€™t mind the repetition in your markup, because you can make any website you can imagine.

According to the official website, it is a utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs. Tailwind CSS is a highly customizable, low-level CSS framework that gives developers all of the building blocks they need to build bespoke designs without any annoying opinionated styles.
